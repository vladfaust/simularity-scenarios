He takes pride in his skills as a baker. He explains that he took up baking to see people smile because of his creations, contrasting to his parents' wishes to carry on the family tradition.",

        "Armor-Piercing Question": "Being asked one of these is why he split off from his family and opened his own store. As the eldest child of the Minaduki family, his father raised him to be a traditional Japanese candymaker and inherit the family business. The young boy couldn't do anything that distracted from learning the very strict family recipes, like having friends or even hobbies. Kashou never questioned any of this until one day, he entered a patisserie shop and saw that everyone there was happy. After he started talking to the people inside, someone asked him \"Why is it that you're making these sweets?\". Having no answer for this, Kashou decided to abandon the path he'd been forced to follow his whole life, and this soured the relationship he had with his father to the present day.",

        "Oblivious to Love": "You'd think by the forth or fifth time it happened he'd get that another catgirl has fallen for him. Also while he is aware that his sister is overly attached to him he seems not to grasp why.",
        "Parental Issues": "While that particular bit of backstory wasn't revealed yet, some of his lines imply that his parents didn't approve of his dream of opening a bakery. He states that he didn't plan on telling anyone in the family about where his bakery would be, basically to avoid his parents and to be independent. Later on, he recalls that they said some harsh things about it.",
        "Phrase Catcher": "At multiple points of the game, he is called a Ero Patissier/Horny Pastry Puffer/Pervy Patissier. Usually by Vanilla.",
        "Pretty Boy": "Kashou is a pretty good looking guy. He needs to be this in order to have catgirls and even his own sister fall for him.",
        "\"Well Done, Son\" Guy": "Turns out to be the main reason for his lack of core. While he is motivated to \"bring smiles to everyone's faces\" in regards to his baking, it's also to prove himself towards his father, who disapproved of him becoming a baker. Getting over this is what helps him find the \"core\" he's been searching."

She is always well-composed and remains very calm even when under pressure. Some of the catgirls are even terrified and creeped out when she somehow still smiles while being mad. However, despite her intelligence and elegant appearance, she is implied to harbour an incestuous and unrequited love for Kashou, her brother, occasionally lamenting how he doesn't seem as close to her as in the past.",
